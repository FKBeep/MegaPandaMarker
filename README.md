MegaPandaMarker (for WoW Classic)

(o.O) Auto-mark smarter. Raid harder.

This addon lets you mark enemies just by moving your mouse over them — no clicking needed. As you mouse over each mob, the addon checks if it should be marked and which mark it should get, based on a priority system you set up in advance.

Here’s how it works in practice:

When you mouse over a mob, the addon checks if it’s listed in your priority database.

* If the mob is important and no other mob has a mark yet, it gets the first available raid marker.
* If another mob is already marked, but the new one has higher priority, the marker is moved to the higher-priority mob.
* If the mob has lower priority, it gets the next free mark instead.
* If you keep mousing over all the mobs in a group, the addon will automatically sort out which ones get which markers — highest priority first.

This way, you can walk through a pack of mobs with your mouse and let the addon handle all the raid marker assignments behind the scenes.

You can customize everything:

* Choose what mobs are important.
* Decide which raid markers are assigned to which classes (e.g., mage = blue square).
* Flag mobs that need crowd control, so they always get the right mark.

This makes setup before a pull fast and accurate — no typing, no target switching, no marking mistakes.

🐼 Why “MegaPanda”?

Because the developer’s main is a Gnome Warrior named MegaPanda on Pyrewoood Village EU Aliance. And she’s not here to negotiate.
