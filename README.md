MegaPandaMarker (for WoW Classic)

(o.O) Auto-mark smarter. Raid harder.

MegaPandaMarker uses a built-in database of mob names with assigned roles and priorities to make marking nearly automatic. Just mouseover enemies during a pull, and the addon handles intelligent marker placement in real time — no need for manual clicks or macros.

Inspired by the chaos of Classic raids and fueled by the tactical brilliance of a Gnome warrior named MegaPanda, this addon brings order to the battlefield.

🛠 Example Use Case

You're running Naxx or ZG. You want Warlocks to banish specific mobs and Tanks to handle the big ones — but without micromanaging every pull. With MegaPandaMarker, just mouse over your targets, and the addon handles smart marker assignment on the fly.

🐼 Why “MegaPanda”?

Because the developer’s main is a Gnome Warrior named MegaPanda on Pyrewoood Village EU Aliance. And she’s not here to negotiate.
